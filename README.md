# Mission Statement
Our app, Student Fitness (pending name), our mission is to redefine the college fitness experience by bridging the gap between physical exertion and mental resilience. 
We believe that a student’s well-being isn't just measured by the weights they lift, but by the clarity and balance they maintain throughout their academic journey. 
By providing a dual-purpose platform, we empower students to cultivate a sustainable lifestyle where body and mind are trained in tandem.

Our app serves as an introduction guide to the gym, stripping away the intimidation factor for beginners while offering robust tools for avid gym goers. 
Looking beyond the weight room and cardio machines, Student Fitness (pending name) functions as a comprehensive mental health guide. Through an integrated mood tracking and a private journal, users can document their emotions alongside their physical milestones. 
This creates a powerful visual history of growth, allowing students to see exactly how their activity influences their overall happiness and stress levels.

Ultimately, we want this app to be more than a workout tracker.
Our goal is to create something for the community that prioritizes self-care and awareness, ensuring that every user has the tools to check in on themselves as often as they check their personal best. 
We believe that a stronger body and a healthier mind are the ultimate academic advantages.
